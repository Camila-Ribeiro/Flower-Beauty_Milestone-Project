## Testing
 
The website was tested many times and I conducted a user test with two users. A few bugs were found during this process like clicking on the button "Read More" wasn't opening the right page, was 404 error or pages weren't opening in a new tab which now is all fixed.

The website version for mobile and ipad works very similar to the desktop and Ipad pro version except for the social media icons that on desktop is placed on the right hand side on a fixed position and on mobile and Ipad it is placed at the top of the Navigation Menu. Also the deck cards across the desktop and Ipad pro are placed on set of 2 or 3 cards in a row and for mobile and ipad it is stacked.
