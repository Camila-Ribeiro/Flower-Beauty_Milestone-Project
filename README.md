## UX
Flower Beauty and Nails is a beautician website directed to users to learn about the services available, the team, prices, location and contact information. The website is simple and structured in a way that is easy to navigate and find the information needed. It was redesigned from and old version (https://flowerbeautyandnails.wordpress.com/) which was incomplete and very dificult to understand.

List of User Stories:

- As a user I want to check servoce's prices on the website, I clicked on Price List on the Menu Navigation,  on the subsection Tabs I choose which service I wanted to check the price. My goal was accomplished very easily.

- As a user I want to contact Flower Beauty and Nails, to perform this action I clicked on Contact on the Menu Navigation and filled up the form with my name, email address and message and submitted my querie, doing that I achieve my goal to contact Flower Beauty and Nails.

## Testing
[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](./blob/master/Testing.md)
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
